Implementation of AutoRT: "AutoRT: Embodied Foundation Models for Large Scale Orchestration of Robotic Agents". This repo will implement the multi agent system that transforms a scene into a list of ranked and priortized tasks for an robotic action mogdel to execute. This is an very effective setup that I personally beleive is the future for swarming robotic foundation models!

This project will be implemented using Swarms, for the various llms and use the official RT-1 as the robotic action model.

## Install
`$ pip3 install autort-swarms `


## Usage
```python



```
